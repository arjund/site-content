<p>Currently ActiveJDBC does not support a feature called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Table_Inheritance">Single Table Inheritance</a>. However it does support just inheritance.</p>

<h1 id="inheritance-diagram"><a href="#TOC">Inheritance diagram</a></h1>
<p>Consider this diagram:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/inheritance_umlet_class_diagram.png" alt="Inheritance diagram" /><p class="caption">Inheritance diagram</p>
</div>
<h1 id="inheritance-usage"><a href="#TOC">Inheritance usage</a></h1>
<p>While there are total of 7 classes, only those classes that have <span style="background-color:lightgreen">   green   </span> background are associated with tables. At the same time, common functionality can be inherited from one class to another. Abstract classes are marked with (A).</p>
<p>In this diagram there are only three tables: MEALS, CAKES and SWORDS. This means that models that are not green are not backed by a table and therefore cannot be used directly.</p>
<p>All functionality declared in models Dessert and Pastry can be used in a model Cake. Same goes for Weapon and Sword. However, Cheese, although can exist in code, is a dud.</p></div>
